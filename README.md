# Upgrade RaspberryPi from a major version to another major one

Right now the script is prepared to upgrade from Raspberry Pi OS Buster (32 or 64 bit) to Bullseye.

Run the script on you RaspberryPi as sudo 

```
sudo bash upgradeRaspberryPi
```

answer yes to all questions and be patient since its a long process

You can also download the new major version and install it on a fresh SD card. On the other hand this script will keep your customizations in place. 

## Edit the script to work on other RaspberryPi OS versions

edit official links and references to OS versions to the desired OS image/version and run the script

### Always hold a backup copy of your current OS
